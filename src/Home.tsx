The year is 2099. After enduring multiple wars and disasters, the world has been rebuilt under the governance of newly established city-states. Among them, the most technologically advanced is the colossal megapolis of "9th New Tokyo," a sprawling city both on the ground and in the sky, seen as a symbol of hope for humanity.
In this city, all systems are managed by highly evolved AIs, with particular attention given to three emotion-bearing AIs: "Kaguya," "Amaterasu," and "Susanoo." Each of these AIs represents a different aspect of the city and plays a crucial role in maintaining the city's order and harmony.
